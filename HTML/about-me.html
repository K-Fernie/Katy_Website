    <h2>What I'm Currently Doing and how I got here</h2>
    <p>Madison Blackstone is a director of brand marketing, with experience managing global teams and
      multi-million-dollar
      campaigns. Her background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management inform her mindful but
      competitive approach. Madison is fueled by her passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural
      advertising.

      sociology and stay in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework.</p>

      project management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for her department.</p>
